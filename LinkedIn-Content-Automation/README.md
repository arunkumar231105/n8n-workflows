LinkedIn Content Automation 🚀
This project is my first AI Agent built in n8n — a complete workflow for automating LinkedIn content creation and publishing.
It demonstrates how AI + automation can handle everything from idea → draft → image → approval → publishing.

⚡ How It Works
Trigger: A Google Sheet stores LinkedIn content topics.
Check: Workflow monitors sheet and checks if a topic is marked as “Pending.”
Drafting: My writing style (from Google Docs) is fetched.
AI Agent: Gemini 2.5 Flash generates a detailed LinkedIn post draft.
Formatting: Custom JavaScript code structures the draft neatly.
Image Generation: Gemini 2.0 creates a matching image → auto-uploaded to Google Drive → link added back to sheet.
Status Update: Google Sheet updates from Pending → Done.
Approval: A Discord bot sends an approval request (Approve/Decline).
Publishing: If approved, the post is automatically published on LinkedIn.
Final Update: Status changes to Posted.
