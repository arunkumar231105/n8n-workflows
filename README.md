# n8n Workflows 🚀

This repository contains my collection of **n8n workflows** — from simple automations to advanced AI-powered agents.  
Each workflow is stored as a JSON file along with its corresponding diagram image for easy reference.

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arunkumar231105/n8n-workflows.git

2. Open n8n → Import workflow → Upload JSON from workflows/.

3. Refer to images/ for a visual overview of each workflow.

📌 Notes

Each workflow folder entry = 1 JSON file + 1 image.

I will keep adding new workflows here as I continue exploring automation, AI agents, and integrations.
